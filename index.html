        <p>The Making of HHMI
            (This abridged interview of B K Handique, as told to Smita Addy, an alumni of HHMI, first appeared in Time Present, Time Past, a volume released on, 2012 to mark the golden jubilee celebrations of the school.)



            Hemalata Handiqui Memorial Institute (HHMI) was set up by eminent scholar and philanthropist Krishna Kanta Handique, in memory of his wife Hemalata Handique. Being an educationist, there could hot have been a more befitting tribute to his wife than building an institution of learning.

            The first English medium school in Jorhat, and the third in Upper Assam, was established in 1962, a few months before the Indo-China War broke out. But its history stretches far back in time and is closely linked to the history of Jorhat and its many citizens who built pioneering educational institutes.

            In the 1920s, Jorhat was a screne town.Handiqui came back home from the United Kingdom and other European countries after completing his studies in Oxford and other centres of learning. After his return, he immersed himself along with other progressive men to establish what would be the first college in Upper Assam, the Jagannath Barooah College. Being an erudite scholar, Handiqui decided not to take up any government job. As he pursued his literacy interests , he also spent time in company of his contemporaries to build Jagannath Barooah College. Members of this progressive group including Tulashi Narayan Sharma, Jajnaswar Sharma, Fanidhar Dutta, Prafulla Pran Changkakoti and Guna Govinda Dutta any many others, persisted with the project right from collecting funds to searching for teachers. Handiqui was asked to become the first Principal. A few members of group become lecturers. The launching of institute based solely on public efforts was a challenge in those days. There were only two reputed colleges region then – Cotton College in Guwahati and Murari Chand College in Sylhet, which is now in Bangladesh. Both were government - funded colleges. The real test was to set up the first private institution for higher education in the North East region, Jagannath Barooah College was finally born in 1930. After India’s Independence, my father accepted the offer to become the first Vice Chancellor of the then-new Gauhati University. He held that position from 1948 to 1957, the year he retired. Tragedy, however, struck our family when my mother died on July 20, 1961. My father held discussions with his peers, among them his childhood friend, the philanthropist Prasanna Kumar Barooah (he was the best man at my parents wedding), as to what kind of educational institute would serve the needs of time. Finally, a consensus evolved that an English medium school would be an appropriate venture. There were many people who came to Jorhat to work in the Indian Air Force and the Army bases, the Tocklai Experimental Station, the Regional Research Laboratory and in offices of the central government. Their families could not join them as there was no English medium school in town. The question then arose as to where to start the school. It was while we were searching for rented house that Prasanna Barooah suggested using the Jorhat Club. Barooah was then the Club’s chairman.</p>
